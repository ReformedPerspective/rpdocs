# 'Book of Praise Content List' Contents

All the links in this list, including the sub-lists, are all ['App link' links](index.md#library-item-types-and-options), so they open inside the app without invoking the mobile device's browser.

There seems to be a problem with the anchor links for the last 4 lists. The internal App browser doesn't handle them properly and jumps down the page for subsequent anchors and is quickly at the very bottom of the page, which is not helpful. Subsplash has said this this is not a priority for them to fix.
