# Push notifications

Push notifications are found under the *App* page on the Subsplash Dashboard. It has the ability to send notifications to all users or users that have subscribed (in their [account settings](account.md)) to a notification group. These notifications can be sent immediately or scheduled.

## Notification Groups

New notification groups can be configured on the right of the Push Notifications page. However, a user must go into his [account settings](account.md) in the App to 'subscribe' to anything other than the default 'General' group which includes all users who have not disabled their notifications.

## Create Notification

A notification, once sent, cannot be sent again, it can only be deleted or duplicated. This means that there are two ways to create a new notification, either use the *Create Notification* button on the top-right, or use the elipsis (i.e. ...) next to a previous notification and select *Duplicate*.

A notification has three things that can be configured:

1. The 'Notification text'. This is a 140 character 'title' that is the main text of the notification.
2. The 'Additional description'. This is an optional text box that shows up as a block of smaller text at the bottom of the notification inside the app once it is clicked on. This seems to be able to take a very large amount of text.
3. The 'Attachment'. This is an Item from the App 'Library'. The notification shows the ['Wide' art](index.md#library-item-types-and-options) associated with the item along with a link that shows as 'View Item'.

## View Past Notifications

It is possible to view past notifications using the [*Inbox* section of your account settings](account.md#Inbox).
