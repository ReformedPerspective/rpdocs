# Subsplash Account and App Settings

The *Settings* section of the Dashboard allows us to set up a number of things pertaining to our account and the App. These are organized into several different pages.

## General

Here we can set the *Time zone*, whether people can take *Notes* within the App (enabled), whether people can search for RP in the Subsplash '*The Church App*' app (disabled), and we can download auto-generated promotional images.

## Developer Accounts

We don't use this, but this is for generating accounts which can be used to upload our App to the Google and Apple app stores. It looks like there is an Apple account configured here, but not Google. This doesn't matter, because Subsplash takes care of this for us.

## App Store info

Here we can set a long and short name for our app for the app stores, keywords so people can find the app more easily, the app's primary language, and a long and short description.

Currently:
### name

 - Long: Reformed Perspective
 - Short: RP

### keywords

```text
God,Bible,Christ,Church App,Church,christian,reformed,outfitters,perspective,canada
```

### language

English

### descriptions

```

Long:
```text
Welcome to the new official Reformed Perspective app. Previously known as Reformed Outfitters, this app is all about equipping Christians and building Christ's Church. 

Use this application to access Reformed Perspective's wealth of News, Articles, and Resources while still using this application to access Psalms, Hymns, Confessions of Faith and Liturgical forms. 

An internet connection is required for full functionality. 

For more information about Reformed Perspective, please visit:

The Reformed Perspective app was developed with the Subsplash App Platform.

## Locations

These map locations can also be found and edited under the ['*More*' tab](home.md#bottom-buttons-tabs) on the home screen settings.

## Users

App administrators and users can be added and configured here. There was a long list of users here that had never logged in (I removed them all), and none of the current staff were there. Perhaps we should change this. It is possible to invite new users here by setting a name, email, phone number (optional), and role.

The possible roles are:

- Administrator: Can manage users and access everything except Giving information
- Billing manager: Can manage payment methods, edit Tax info, and receives all invoices and receipts
- Giving manager: Can view Giving content and take Giving-related actions (NOT RELEVANT)
- Content manager: Can manage Media, Events, Apps, and Website

## Subscription

There is information here about our current storage use (2.2 GB of 250 GB) and Upcoming and Past payments, as well as the payment method.

## Import

There is something terribly wrong with this link. I think it's trying to open up the Subsplash 'Giving', but we don't have access to that.
