### Publish an Ad (new type)

Since an Ad is just a short 'Post' that gets added to the end of regular posts, it's simply a matter of doing a few, important steps:

1. Create a new Post and add the Ad content. The 'Advertisement' text will be automatically added to the top and bottom of the Ad when it shows up on the site
2. Set the '*Ad-New*' Category. This sets up the Ad to be shown at the bottom of regular articles.
3. Set the '*expires*' Tag. This allows the [Expiry script](website/scripts.md#Expire-Ads) to find it and check the expiry date.
4. Set a date for the Ad to expire. This allows the script to expire the Ad when the time comes.
5. Publish the Ad when ready.

**NOTE**: Any post can be expired by setting the '*expires*' tag. The script will handle this.
