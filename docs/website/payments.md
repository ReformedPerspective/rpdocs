# Payment Processing

The RP 'Donate' page has a few ways that people can donate.

## Paypal

This uses the RP PayPal account to receive payments. This is done via a custom '*hosted button*'.

## Square

People can make one-time or monthly credit card payments using our custom Square subscription form. This can be found in Square by:

1. Go to [Online Checkout](https://squareup.com/dashboard/ecom/online-checkout/checkout-links) on the Square dashboard
2. We use the first 'link' in the list: *Donate to Reformed Perspective*. If you click on it, a sidebar opens up
3. Scroll down the sidebar and click '*Customize*' in the 'Checkout button' section to customize the look of the button
4. Click '*Edit*' in the 'Details' section and scroll down and expand '*Advanced settings*' to get more options

## Pre-Authorized Debit

A PDF form can be downloaded and sent to the office.

## e-Transfer

This just uses the office email.
