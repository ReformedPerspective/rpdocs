# Payment Processing

The RP 'Donate' page has a few ways that people can donate.

## Paypal

This uses the RP PayPal account to receive payments. This is done via a custom '*hosted button*'.

## ~~Square~~Bambora

People can make one-time or monthly credit card payments using our custom Bambora subscription form.

This is all handled by the Bambora API.

## Pre-Authorized Debit

A PDF form can be downloaded and sent to the office.

## e-Transfer

This just uses the office email.
