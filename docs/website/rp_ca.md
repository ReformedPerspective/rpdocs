## Advertisements

The new Ads are 'posts' that are categorized with the 'ad-new' category. Only one Ad can be active (i.e. post_status=publish) at a time. The Ad is placed at the bottom of every article for a set number of days so we can guarantee a certain amount of exposure.

## Admin Interface

Since this is Wordpress, the Admin interface where all the settings are configured and all the Posts and Pages, etc. are created, is at [https://reformedperspective.ca/wp-admin](https://reformedperspective.ca/wp-admin). There are many things configured here, most of which are standard, Wordpress features.

There are some special features that are either plugins, or are part of the [Benchpress theme](benchpress.md). The Benchpress options are found under the [Benchpress Options section](benchpress.md#Benchpress-Options) in the Wordpress Dashboard sidebar.

## Menu

The main menu (accessed via the 'hamburger' menu button at the top-right) has several sections to it:

1. A user information section with either a 'Create an Account' button or information about the user's interactions on the site.
2. A set of SVG icons with links to various Category pages on the site.
    - There is one exception to this 'Category' rule, namely the 'Past Articles' page, which is a special page that lists all the articles on the site sorted by Category.
3. A set of fancy line-art icons (called Sub Sites) that link out to other important pages on this site and to other RP web properties.
4. A section that shows current Advertisements of the old kind. The new Ads will go at the bottom of articles.
