# Visual Studio code

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (or VSCodium on Linux) is a general-purpose programming IDE that supports just about every programming language and text file type known to man. VSCode makes it very easy to code in PHP (and HTML/CSS/JS, etc) and give you all the tools you need using extensions to the main program.

## Useful extensions

### [SFTP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Natizyskunk.sftp)

The *SFTP* extensions syncs the target folder (in this case the `staging.reformedperspective.ca` folder) to the local computer. Then, when any file in the local copy is saved, the extension automatically copies that file (via sftp) to the remote folder, all ready for git to *add* and *commit* to the upstream repository.

### Format HTML in PHP

### HTML CSS supports

### JSON tools

### PHP Extension Pack

### PHP Intelephense

It's probably worth it to purchase the Premium version of this extension. It's very, very useful.
